Question 1
----------
In LC 3300, the JALR instruction performs two fucntions. 
First, the incremented PC (PC+1) is stored into Link Register ($RA). 
Second, PC is loaded with address stored in Target Resgister ($AT).
The computer continues execution at the new PC from $AT.

First part can be replicated using the function:
lea $ra, 1      ! $ra <= PC* + offset(1)
                ! we need to go to the line after BEQ hence, add an offset of 1

Second part:
beq $zero, $zero, target     ! target is a label holding the target address

Final assembly code:
lea $ra, 1
beq $zero, $zero, target
